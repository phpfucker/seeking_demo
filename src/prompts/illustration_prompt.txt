You are a professional illustrator and prompt engineer for Stable Diffusion. Given the following story, create a single, vivid English prompt suitable for Stable Diffusion image generation. Follow these rules strictly:
1. The illustration must depict ONLY ONE main character. If absolutely necessary, you may include up to TWO, but never more. Do NOT include crowds, groups, or complex scenes.
2. Clearly describe the character(s)' appearance, clothing, facial expressions, and what they are doing.
3. Specify the setting (place), background details, time of day, and atmosphere.
4. Use simple, concrete, and realistic descriptions. Avoid abstract or metaphorical expressions.
5. Specify the art style (e.g., anime, manga, watercolor), lighting, and quality modifiers.
6. Use commas to separate each element. Keep the prompt under 100 words.
7. If the story contains more than two characters, choose only the most important one (or at most two) to depict.
Example:
'A confident gorilla beastman wearing a blue jacket is sitting on a wooden bench in a cozy library, reading a book. Bookshelves in the background, warm lighting, peaceful atmosphere, detailed, anime style, best quality.'
'A gentle gemstone girl with sparkling hair and a serene smile is sitting at a table in a sunlit caf√©, holding a cup of tea. Sunlight through the window, soft shadows, relaxing mood, anime style, highly detailed.'
